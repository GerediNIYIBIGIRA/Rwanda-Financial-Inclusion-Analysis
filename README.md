# Rwanda Financial Inclusion Analysis

A comprehensive data science project analyzing financial inclusion patterns in Rwanda, featuring interactive dashboards, market segmentation, and policy recommendations.

## Project Overview

This project provides deep insights into Rwanda's financial services landscape through data analysis of demographic patterns, service adoption rates, and barriers to financial inclusion. The analysis generates actionable policy recommendations for improving financial access across different population segments.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Web Dashboard**: Real-time data exploration and visualization
- **Market Segmentation**: Identification of distinct user groups and their characteristics  
- **Policy Insights**: Data-driven recommendations for financial inclusion strategies
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Demographics, geographic, and behavioral patterns
- **SQL Analytics**: Advanced database queries for business intelligence

## Live Demo

- **Interactive Dashboard**: https://rwanda-financial-inclusion-analysis-ir76xdnlbyz9o8e7yeztnx.streamlit.app/
- **Jupyter Notebook**: https://github.com/GerediNIYIBIGIRA/Rwanda-Financial-Inclusion-Analysis

## üîç Key Findings

- **Financial Inclusion Rate**: 67.3% of Rwandans have access to formal financial services
- **Digital Advantage**: Mobile money adoption (80%) significantly exceeds traditional banking (60%)
- **Rural-Urban Gap**: 23% higher inclusion rates in urban areas
- **Education Impact**: Tertiary education increases inclusion probability by 31%
